# dsh-threads

English | [中文](README.zh.md)

A [DeepSeek Harness](https://github.com/deepseek-ai/deepseek-harness) plugin. Your main conversation acts as a dispatcher: when a task is self-contained, it opens a **thread** — a real session you can click into and keep talking to — and when the thread finishes, a short summary comes back to the main conversation.

> Status: **M2b**. Projects (a folder plus one main conversation), threads opened from a project, reports back to it, `thread_reply` and `/thread <task>` work. Threads open in the right sidebar with their own composer and can be marked resolved (M2b). In-conversation cards and proposals arrive in M2c. See [docs/IMPLEMENTATION.md](docs/IMPLEMENTATION.md).

Requires DeepSeek Harness 0.2.1-rc.2 (Desktop) and Node ≥ 22.19.
